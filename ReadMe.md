The legendary [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) and [Doom II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_II) games were ported to countless interesting and exotic platforms, but vintage Motorola mobile phones were overlooked by ports at the time. For nostalgic reasons, I decided to fix this unfortunate situation!

// TODO: Video

P2kDoom is an ambitious project focused on porting various [id Tech 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_engine) engines to vintage Motorola mobile phones running on the Motorola P2K (Platform2000) platform. This innovative platform, popular between 2000 and 2010, fostered a small but vibrant modding community scene in the 2000s. Enthusiasts developed unique Patches and ElfPacks with tons of ELF applications to enhance the functionality of these devices.

## Ports to P2K

The ports are implemented as ELF applications and require some custom firmware (Monster Pack) to run Doom on these devices.

### 1. [P2kDoom8](P2kDoom8)

A port of the **Doom8088** engine by **[FrenkelS](https://github.com/FrenkelS)**, originally designed for old 16-bit DOS computers with [Intel 8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) or [Intel 80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) processors. Optimized for low-tier graphics and low-performance phones, such as the Motorola C380, C650, RAZR V3, E398, ROKR E1, and others.
